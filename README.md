Built in openFrameworks.

Requires my fork of the [ofxGpuParticles](https://github.com/radiodario/ofxGpuParticles) to work, in order to use geometry shaders
also requires ofxOsc and ofxGui.

Please don't blatantly copy it, but feel free to use it as a starting point for your own particle systems and visualisations, and if you do, let me know what you made!
